**The front**
> ## Write and deploy a stateful React.js/Redux application to the web by **the 15th of june**

### Status

* I've made a few test apps recently with React, but nothing with _lots_ of state.
* Next step is to implement Redux in an application that has a complex state.
* I've tried to write a simple redux-react scaffold that I can reuse, but there's one niggly bug.

### Status

* Rewritten in python :ballot_box_with_check:
* Unsure whether we should persist the data to s3, or use a PG database in the backend. Currently exploring both options.
* Need to update tests when I know which implementation
* Meeting with Rob Bowley and Anna Goss on 23rd May to discuss its future.
* Possibly using the publishing platform's forms service.
