We at Co-op Digital hadn't started writing OKRs until a few months after I started.

Here's a list of some of the things I did (clearly in raw note form right now)

> Duration: October 2016 - April 2017

I think being Co-op is embodying the spirit to go above and beyond for people who need help, near or far. To face into new new challenges, learning new skills to help along the way, and trying to do it all with a positive attitude.

Here are some of the things I did, see how the above fits in.

## All
I used to write code mostly in C++, C# and node.js.
Since starting at digital I've written code in these (new to me) languages:
+ python (flask, django)
+ go
+ ruby-on-rails
+ react.js/redux

also used frameworks/services like:
+ jekyll
+ docker
+ travis

I'm a lot better at writing shell scripts & terminal commands, and using VIM too.

### Presentations

I've given presentations to

* Co-op Members' council
* The group exec board
* Enterprise leaders
* Digital leaders

I've also spoken at the Digital All-Team event.

I think I've been able to communicate effectively why Digital, our digital products and services, working in an Agile way are good for us as a business and a team.

Like the rest of my team, I've been a big part in showing food what digital and agile can be too. I've engaged with stakeholders across the food business, getting to know retail IT, business insights teams, paul colbeck, blah blah

### Third parties

I've also represented Co-op to third party and external agencies:

* I represented Co-op, & Digital at Amaze's office, in meetings about their Product Finder integration on wine.coop.co.uk, and have been their point of call for integration help, and debugging any problems they encounter. I also wrote integration documentation to help them.

* Reflexis meeting (3rd Party)

## Helping out other Colleagues

### eStore

eStore - HTML5 Ad Banners, SEO and analytics, as well as generally pitching in with episerver. (terms and conds).

When Co-op electrical was going live they needed people pitching in; I wrote HTML5 ad banners for doubleclick for them; I advised and helped search engine optimization, as well as the google analytics traffic we were recieving.

I helped to performance profile the website on various mobile devices to understand how/where users were dropping off the site.

### Service Maturity Standards
The delivery community needed a website for their Service Manual (what it means to be alpha, beta or live) on a very tight deadline ready for a show & tell.

I was asked to help and happily obliged, and succe

### Membership join us campaign
Ciaran and I paired dev/design to make 6 different pages for the memebership 'join us' campaign, on short notice, to use for A/B testing.

### Content Design

My content design skills have improved too.

I've written week notes often, blog posts, report documents for leading the way discovery.

Not to mention the _many_ presentations to the execs/councils, and countless show & tells.

I can communicate better, and say what I need to more succinctly, through working at Co-op.

### User Research

I've personally conducted store interviews with at least 12 colleagues over 6 different Co-op stores.

While being perfectly unbiased is challenging, I am aware in an interview of the importance of not asking leading questions, not making assumptions and allowing the subject to fill the silence.
