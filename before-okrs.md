We at Co-op Digital hadn't started writing OKRs until a few months after I started.

Here's a list of some of the things I did (clearly in raw note form right now)

> Duration: October 2016 - April 2017

## All
I used to predominantly write in node.js and c#.
Since starting at digital I've written code in these (new to me) languages:
+ python
+ go
+ ruby-on-rails
+ react
+ java

also used frameworks/services like:
+ jekyll
+ docker
+ travis
